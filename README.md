These are the codes for GCD and multiplicative inverse that will be used further on to perform different operations in cryptography. The algorithm used
here is a brute force approach and a better method will be to use Extended Euclidean method where during the iterartion before the last iteration, back
tracking is done to find out value of x in this case.
